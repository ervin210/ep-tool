# Entity Property Tool

This [Atlassian Forge App][4] is written to be an easy to use tool to view and manipulate entity properties. 

This App is [available on the Atlassian Marketplace][5] for you to use; for free.

However, if you wish to modify the tool and run your own copy, simply run:

``` bash
forge register
```

And start developing! If you have any issues with this App, please feel free to raise it in the bug tracker.
