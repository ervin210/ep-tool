## Privacy Policy

This App does not store any data outside of Atlassian. The App runs entirely on 
Atlassian. This App does allow users to modify any entity properties on many product 
objects.

As a result, this App is able to access, but never stores:

 - Account and Profile Information
 - Content you provide through Atlassian products
 - Content you provide through our websites
 - Any logging that the app may perform

In short, data can be accessed by the App in transit but that data is only every accessible on the users browser or the Atlassian hosted environment.
